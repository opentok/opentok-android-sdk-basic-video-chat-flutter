# opentok-flutter-basic-video-chat

This repository is providing Basic video chat sample using OpenTok SDK and Flutter.

This project is a kick off projet to explore Flutter integration and it is not oficially supported by Vonage.

## Setup flutter SDK

Download, extract and confgure [flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Fortunately, flutter comes with a tool that allows us to verify if SDK and all required "components" are present and configured correctly. Run this command:

Check if everything is configured correctly:

```cmd
flutter doctor
```

## Run the app

There are multiple ways to run the app. The easiest way is to open the whole project in the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with [Flutter plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio) installed. Open Flutter project (the root of this repo) and run app targetting one of the platforms.

Fill `OpenTokConfig`

Optionally you can open iOS project (`ios/Runner.xcworkspace` folder) in Xcode and run iOS app or Android project in Android Studio (`android` folder) and run Android App. This is possible because Flutter project consists of iOS and Android projects.

## Set up credentials

You will need a valid [TokBox account](https://tokbox.com/account/user/signup) for most of the sample projects. OpenTok credentials (`API_KEY`, `SESSION_ID`, `TOKEN`) are stored inside `OpenTokConfig` class (inside `main.dart` file). For these sample applications, credentials can be retrieved from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/projects) and hardcoded in the application, however for a production environment server should provide these credentials (check [Basic-Video-Chat](/Basic-Video-Chat) project). 

> Note: To facilitate testing connect to the same session using [OpenTok Playground](https://tokbox.com/developer/tools/playground/) (web client).
## Known issues

When hosting the Native Android/iOS view in the Flutter app the [PlatformViewFactory](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/plugin/platform/PlatformViewFactory.html) must be used to create instance of the native view ([PlatformView](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-views)). However Opentok SDK is creating views for video streams by itself. This means that we need a hack to be able to display opentok videos within the Flutter app. Instead of creating native view (using the `PlatformViewFactory`), app creates a container view (also using the `PlatformViewFactory`) and latter attaches Opentok video streams to this container. Unfortunately this solution requires to store view in the static property.
